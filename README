plconfig - configuration tool for Intellon-based powerline bridges

Should compile without modification under FreeBSD 4.x or later and Mac OS X.

Just type 'make'.


Change log
----------

0.2: plaintext passwords are now hashed correctly as per the HomePlug
     specification (no longer homebrew MD5); as such passwords should now
     be compatible with the Windows setup software supplied by Intellon
     (note that -s <password> does no longer set up the same key as
     in 0.1! Of course -s 0x<key> behaves as before...)

0.1: initial release
